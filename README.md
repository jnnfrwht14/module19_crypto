## Using the PCA data shows there's a high concentration of elements with the lower inertia at 4. This means there's a smaller standard deviation in the data for the cluster relative to the cluster's mean value. The impact of using fewer features to cluster the data shows four distinct clusters with little overlap.

## For those interested in trading crypto or mining crypto, a low standard deviation suggests prices are clustered close to the mean, resulting in possibly lower volatility in trading patterns.  Higher standard deviation, as shown in the original data, indicates more fluctuations in price and is indicative of high volatility.
